## 🧩Description

The Aspen project is something I started during my weekends to make productive use of my free time. I was captivated by the Figma design and decided to fully implement it for Android using Jetpack Compose. This project is a design-focused endeavor where I deconstructed most parts of the design into reusable components, carefully crafted them, and eventually brought everything together to create a cohesive and functional application.
